# Arduino Sketches
A collection of random sketches that I've used over the years. Doesn't include any major projects, moreso just practice sketches.

1. Buttons and RGB: Controls the color output of a RGB module using three buttons.
2. Controlled LED: Potentiometer and LED circuit.
3. Controlled RGB: Potentiometer and RGB module circuit.
